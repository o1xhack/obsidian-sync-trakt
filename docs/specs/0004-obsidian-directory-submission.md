# 0004 — Submission preparation for Obsidian Community Plugins directory

- **Status**: implemented
- **Released in**: 0.4.0
- **Date**: 2026-05-11
- **Authors**: @o1xhack, Claude

## Context

By 0.3.2 the plugin is feature-stable, install via BRAT works smoothly, and
nothing blocks daily use. The next step is submission to the official
[Obsidian Community Plugins directory](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/blob/master/community-plugins.json),
which would let users install through Obsidian's built-in plugin browser
without needing BRAT.

The submission process is a single-file PR to `obsidian-releases`. The
[validation bot](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/blob/master/.github/workflows/validate-plugin-entry.yml)
runs automatically on the PR and rejects entries that violate any of a
handful of hard rules. **One of those rules blocks our current state:**

```javascript
if (plugin.id?.toLowerCase().includes('obsidian')) {
  addError(`Please don't use the word \`obsidian\` in the plugin ID. ...`);
}
```

Our current `manifest.json` has `"id": "obsidian-sync-trakt"`. We have to
change it. That's a data-touching change (the plugin id is the folder
name under `.obsidian/plugins/<id>/`), so we also need a migration story
for existing BRAT-installed users — otherwise their data.json sits
abandoned at the old folder path while the upgraded plugin sees a fresh
default-state at the new folder path.

While we're touching the manifest, we also fix a long-standing minor
issue: `minAppVersion` is set to `1.4.0`, but our actual minimum is
`1.6.6` (we use `fileManager.trashFile` which has `@since 1.6.6` in
the official `obsidian.d.ts`). Without enabling `deleteRemovedItems`,
the older floor was harmless. But the declaration was inaccurate, and
fixing it before public submission is the right time.

## Goals / Non-goals

### Goals

- `manifest.json` `id` complies with the bot's "no `obsidian` in id" rule
- `manifest.json` `minAppVersion` accurately reflects the highest
  `@since` of any API the plugin actually calls
- Existing BRAT users (anyone who's been running 0.3.x) get their
  data — Trakt tokens, TMDB cache, history state, all settings —
  migrated to the new folder path on first launch of 0.4.0,
  **transparently**, with a single one-time confirmation Notice
- After migration, **binary files in the old folder are removed**
  (main.js / manifest.json / styles.css) so the duplicate entry
  disappears from Obsidian's plugin list. **data.json is kept** as
  a recovery safety net — see "Update: 0.5.2 cleanup" below
- Submission to the directory is decoupled from this release — 0.4.0
  ships first, then the user manually submits the PR (this gives them
  control over the timing and PR description)

### Non-goals

- **Renaming the GitHub repo.** The repo stays at
  `o1xhack/obsidian-sync-trakt`. GitHub redirects + BRAT's HTTP-301
  following mean external links / BRAT subscriptions keep working
  with no churn. Keeping the repo name also keeps URLs in 9 READMEs,
  spec docs, changelog, release notes all valid without a doc sweep.
- **Renaming the display name.** `"Obsidian Sync Trakt"` stays. The
  bot doesn't check display name, only id. Reviewers occasionally
  request dropping "Obsidian" from display names, but it's a
  comment-and-fix flow during human review, not a bot block. If
  flagged, we change it in a 0.4.1 — cheaper than pre-emptively
  updating all docs.
- **Auto-deleting the old folder.** Leaving it in place protects users
  who downgrade. After a few releases (when downgrade is unlikely),
  a future cleanup spec could add a "remove legacy folder" step.

## Design

Three small pieces — manifest update, migration code, tests.

### Part A — Manifest update

```diff
- "id": "obsidian-sync-trakt",
+ "id": "sync-trakt",
- "minAppVersion": "1.4.0",
+ "minAppVersion": "1.6.6",
```

`name`, `description`, `author`, `authorUrl`, `isDesktopOnly` stay
unchanged.

### Part B — Migration code (in main.ts loadSettings)

The migration runs **once** per device, the first time 0.4.0 starts up
on that device. Trigger: `data.json` is missing from the new folder
(plugin's default load returns `null`) AND `data.json` exists at the
old folder path.

```typescript
async loadSettings() {
  let loaded = (await this.loadData()) as Partial<TraktrSettings> | null;
  if (!loaded) {
    loaded = await this.migrateFromLegacyFolder();
  }
  Object.assign(this.settings, DEFAULT_SETTINGS, loaded ?? {});
}

private async migrateFromLegacyFolder(): Promise<Partial<TraktrSettings> | null> {
  const legacyPath = normalizePath(
    `${this.app.vault.configDir}/plugins/obsidian-sync-trakt/data.json`,
  );
  try {
    const exists = await this.app.vault.adapter.exists(legacyPath);
    if (!exists) return null;

    const raw = await this.app.vault.adapter.read(legacyPath);
    const parsed = JSON.parse(raw) as Partial<TraktrSettings>;

    // Write to the new folder via the standard plugin API so it's
    // canonically located at `.obsidian/plugins/sync-trakt/data.json`.
    await this.saveData(parsed);

    new Notice(
      getTranslator(parsed.uiLanguage as UiLanguage | undefined ?? "en")(
        "notice.migratedFromLegacyFolder",
      ),
      8000,
    );
    console.info(
      "[Traktr] Migrated data.json from " +
      ".obsidian/plugins/obsidian-sync-trakt/ → .obsidian/plugins/sync-trakt/. " +
      "Old folder left in place; safe to delete manually after confirming.",
    );
    return parsed;
  } catch (e) {
    console.warn("[Traktr] Legacy-folder migration failed:", e);
    return null;
  }
}
```

Key decisions:

- **Uses `vault.adapter.read`** (a low-level filesystem API) to read
  from outside our plugin's own folder. `loadData()` only reads our
  own folder, so we can't use it for cross-folder reading.
- **Catches all exceptions** and degrades to "no migration, use
  DEFAULT_SETTINGS". A migration failure should never leave the user
  unable to launch the plugin.
- **Translates the Notice** using the recovered `uiLanguage` if
  available, falling back to English. So a user who had set the UI to
  Chinese still sees the migration message in Chinese.
- **Does not delete the legacy folder.** A `console.info` line tells
  power users it's safe to delete manually. Automated deletion is
  out of scope here — too risky for too little benefit (one folder
  per Obsidian vault).

### Part C — Idempotency check

After the first run, `data.json` exists in the new folder, so
`loadData()` returns the migrated state on subsequent runs and
`migrateFromLegacyFolder` is never called. The check is implicit:
the migration only runs when `loaded === null`.

The legacy folder's `data.json` is **not** modified during migration,
so if the user keeps both 0.3.x (via BRAT pinning) and 0.4.0
installed simultaneously, both versions remain functional with their
own state. No corruption hazard.

### Submission flow (out of scope code-wise, in scope process-wise)

After 0.4.0 release lands and works in the user's main vault:

1. User forks `obsidianmd/obsidian-releases`
2. Edits `community-plugins.json`, adds at the end:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "sync-trakt",
     "name": "Obsidian Sync Trakt",
     "author": "o1xhack",
     "description": "Sync your Trakt.tv watchlist, watch history, favorites, and ratings into Obsidian notes — with metadata localization and detailed per-episode watch timestamps.",
     "repo": "o1xhack/obsidian-sync-trakt"
   }
   ```
3. Opens PR titled `Add plugin: Obsidian Sync Trakt`
4. Fills the PR template (checkboxes for the 9 self-review items)
5. Waits for `Ready for review` label from the bot
6. Addresses reviewer comments if any

## Edge cases

| # | Scenario | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Fresh install of 0.4.0 (no legacy folder) | `loadData()` returns null; legacy folder check returns false; falls back to DEFAULT_SETTINGS. Normal first-run experience |
| 2 | 0.3.x user upgrading via BRAT | `loadData()` returns null (new folder empty); legacy folder check finds the old data.json; migration runs; Notice shown; subsequent loads see the migrated state |
| 3 | User reverts 0.4.0 → 0.3.x via BRAT | Legacy folder's data.json was never deleted, so 0.3.x picks back up where it left off. Any changes made in 0.4.0 are NOT propagated back — they live in the new folder. Documented as expected |
| 4 | User has both versions installed (legacy + new ids) somehow | Each version reads its own folder; no cross-contamination. Edge case unlikely in practice but safe |
| 5 | Legacy data.json is malformed JSON | `JSON.parse` throws; caught; logged; falls back to DEFAULT_SETTINGS. Plugin still launches |
| 6 | Filesystem permission denied on legacy folder | `vault.adapter.read` throws; caught; logged; falls back to DEFAULT_SETTINGS |
| 7 | User explicitly deletes legacy folder after migration | No effect — current state is in the new folder. Cleanup encouraged but not required |
| 8 | Migration runs successfully but `saveData()` fails | Try-catch around saveData would let plugin start with the parsed state in memory but no on-disk backup. We don't add an extra try around saveData here — if it fails, something larger is wrong and we want it surfaced. Plugin will still work for the current session |

## Tests

`tests/i18n.smoke.ts`:

- Migration path is reachable via a mock vault adapter that returns
  a known-good data.json from the legacy path
- Migration handles malformed JSON gracefully (returns null, doesn't
  throw)
- Migration handles missing legacy file (returns null, doesn't throw)
- After migration, the parsed state matches the source legacy state
  byte-for-byte (no mutation in transit)

Migration is tested in isolation as a pure async function. The
`onload`-level integration is covered by manual smoke during release
verification.

## Migration / backward compatibility

- **From 0.3.x via BRAT**: transparent — see edge case 2
- **Fresh install**: no migration runs; standard first-run setup
- **Downgrade to 0.3.x**: works — legacy folder still contains the
  pre-upgrade state (and possibly newer state if BRAT polled before
  the user reverted, but BRAT doesn't sync back)

## Update: 0.5.2 cleanup

The original 0.4.0 design kept the entire legacy folder around
indefinitely. Real-world feedback after the 0.4.0 → 0.5.1 BRAT
upgrade flow showed two issues:

1. **Most users don't know to delete the legacy folder.** Without an
   automated cleanup, it persists forever as dead weight, taking up
   space in `.obsidian/plugins/` and (until 0.5.1's display-name
   rename) showing as a duplicate entry in the plugin list.
2. **Even with the rename**, the legacy plugin entry is still
   discoverable and confusing — users see two "Trakt-ish" plugins and
   don't know which is canonical, even when one is disabled.

The fix in 0.5.2: **after successful migration, delete the legacy
folder's binary files (`main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css`) but
keep `data.json`**.

### Why this specific subset

- **manifest.json deletion** is what makes Obsidian stop recognizing
  the folder as a plugin → the duplicate entry disappears from
  Settings → Community plugins. This is the primary user-visible win.
- **main.js / styles.css** removed for tidiness; they're useless
  without manifest.json anyway.
- **data.json kept** as a recovery snapshot. If something goes
  catastrophically wrong with the new folder, the user can re-install
  the old version manually (download main.js + manifest.json +
  styles.css from 0.3.4 release) and find their state intact.

### Implementation

A new `cleanupLegacyBinaries()` method runs unconditionally on every
`onload`, **after** `loadSettings` (so migration has completed if it
needed to). It's idempotent — missing files / locked files / permission
errors are swallowed via try/catch and retried next launch. Never
blocks plugin startup on cleanup failures.

```typescript
private async cleanupLegacyBinaries(): Promise<void> {
  const base = `${this.app.vault.configDir}/plugins/${LEGACY_PLUGIN_ID}`;
  for (const file of LEGACY_BINARY_FILES) {
    const path = normalizePath(`${base}/${file}`);
    try {
      if (await this.app.vault.adapter.exists(path)) {
        await this.app.vault.adapter.remove(path);
      }
    } catch (e) {
      console.debug(`[Traktr] Could not remove ${path}:`, e);
    }
  }
}
```

The unconditional execution (vs running only after migration) is
deliberate: devices that migrated under 0.4.0-0.5.1 (before this
cleanup existed) will get their legacy folders tidied on first
launch of 0.5.2+. No special "I just migrated" flag needed.

### Multi-device safety

When one device runs the cleanup, the vault sync layer (Obsidian Sync,
iCloud, etc.) propagates the binary deletions to other devices. For
devices still on 0.3.x at that moment:

1. The next time Obsidian launches on that device, it tries to load
   the plugin from the legacy folder
2. Without manifest.json, the plugin doesn't load
3. BRAT auto-update detects the latest release at 0.5.2+, downloads
   to the NEW folder (`sync-trakt/`) because the new manifest's id is
   `sync-trakt`
4. The new plugin's `migrateFromLegacyFolder` finds the still-intact
   `data.json` in the legacy folder and migrates from it normally

So the cleanup is safe even when triggered before all devices have
upgraded. The window where a device shows "plugin failed to load" is
typically invisible because BRAT runs immediately at launch.

### Edge cases added to the matrix

| # | Scenario | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| 9 | 0.5.2 first launch on a device that migrated under 0.4.x or 0.5.x | `loadSettings()` returns existing migrated state (no re-migration); `cleanupLegacyBinaries()` runs unconditionally, removes any remaining legacy binaries, leaves data.json |
| 10 | data.json was deleted but binaries still exist in legacy folder | Migration source missing, migration short-circuits with null; cleanup still removes binaries (idempotent); fresh-install fallback applies |
| 11 | All legacy files already cleaned up | cleanupLegacyBinaries finds nothing to delete, all `exists()` checks return false, no-op |
| 12 | User manually re-creates a binary file in the legacy folder (e.g. via Obsidian Sync conflict resolution dropping in a stale main.js) | Next launch cleanup removes it again. Idempotent across rounds |

## Future work

- **Auto-delete `data.json` after a grace period** — could happen in
  a much later release (say N=5 from the rename), once the recovery
  pathway is clearly no longer needed. Not pressing — empty data.json
  file is tiny.
- **Submission to directory** — process documented above; user
  executes manually after this release
- **Display name change if reviewer requests** — addressed proactively
  in 0.5.1 after real-world dual-entry confusion (independent of
  reviewer feedback)
