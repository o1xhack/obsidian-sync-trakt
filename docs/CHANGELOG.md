# Changelog

Notable changes per release. The plugin follows [semver](https://semver.org/)
loosely — `0.x.y` is the pre-stable iteration line; the major bump to
`1.0.0` will land once the feature set is verified end-to-end and the
plugin is submitted to Obsidian's official Community Plugins directory.

For the full design rationale behind major changes, see [`specs/`](specs/).

## 0.2.0 — 2026-05-10

**Major: incremental sync.** Steady-state sync wall time drops from
3-5 minutes to under 10 seconds for typical libraries.

### Added

- **TMDB metadata cache.** Each `(type, tmdbId, language)` triple is
  cached in `data.json` after first fetch, with a configurable TTL
  (default 90 days, ±5 days jitter so entries don't all expire on the
  same day) and lazy stale-while-revalidate semantics. Cache survives
  device-to-device sync. New setting: **TMDB cache TTL**. New button:
  **Clear TMDB cache**.
- **Incremental Trakt history fetch.** Sync now stores the
  aggregated history state in `data.json` (per-show + per-movie watch
  timestamps, plus the set of every event id seen). Each subsequent
  sync queries `/sync/history?start_at=lastIncrementalSyncAt` and
  merges new events into the stored state. Watching a single new
  episode now costs ~1 Trakt history call instead of ~150.
- **Periodic full history refresh** for deletion detection. Every
  `historyFullRefreshIntervalDays` (default 7), the next sync re-pulls
  the full history without `start_at`, compares the event-id set
  against `knownEventIds`, and rebuilds state from scratch when
  events were deleted on Trakt's side. New setting:
  **History full-refresh interval**. New command:
  **Traktr: Force full history refresh**.
- **Settings auto-reload on app focus.** The plugin re-reads
  `data.json` from disk when Obsidian becomes visible again (e.g. when
  the user switches back from another app on iPhone after their Mac
  finished a sync). No more "I have to disable + re-enable the plugin
  to see settings my Mac just synced over."
- **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** — comprehensive technical reference.
- **`docs/specs/`** — design spec folder; [0001](specs/0001-incremental-sync.md)
  documents the 0.2.0 work.
- **`docs/CHANGELOG.md`** — this file.

### Changed

- README "Acknowledgements" section reframed across all 9 languages —
  the project is now its own architecture, not a direct fork of
  upstream code.
- LICENSE annotations simplified to plain `Copyright (c) … (url)`
  notices side by side; both apply, both preserved.

### Migration

The first 0.2.0 sync is the same cost as a 0.1.x sync (cold cache, no
history state). Subsequent syncs are fast. No manual action required;
fields default to the right values when missing from `data.json`.

See [spec 0001](specs/0001-incremental-sync.md) for the full design
trade-offs.

## 0.1.4 — 2026-05-10

**Fix: live sync progress visible on mobile.**

The 0.1.3 progress reporting only updated the desktop status bar.
Obsidian's `addStatusBarItem()` is documented as desktop-only; on iOS /
Android, calling `.setText()` is a silent no-op. The user reported that
tapping **Traktr: Sync** on iPhone looked completely silent — no
visible progress until the final notice.

Fix: every progress tick now also drives a persistent `Notice` (created
with `duration=0` so it stays on screen, then updated in-place via
`Notice.setMessage()`). The notice is hidden when sync finishes,
including in the error path.

## 0.1.3 — 2026-05-10

**Major: TMDB title/poster fallback + sync progress + Bases docs.**

### TMDB title fallback

User report: most movie titles came back as English even with metadata
language set to `zh-CN`. Root cause: TMDB moderators sometimes lock the
`title` field on a `zh-CN` translation row to blank (especially for
movies without an official mainland release); the API does not
auto-fall-back to other Chinese variants.

Fix: switched to `?language=X&append_to_response=translations` and
added a client-side picker that walks the translations array. For
`zh-CN` we try **CN → TW → HK → SG → any other zh entry**. Same pattern
Jellyfin / Radarr / tinyMediaManager all use.

### TMDB poster fallback

Same root cause — TMDB returns `null` for `poster_path` on movies
without a poster tagged in the requested language. Fix: when a
language-specific request returns null, retry without the language
parameter to get the default poster.

### Sync progress

Replaced the `Promise.all` burst over all items with a
bounded-concurrency pool (5 in flight). Live status bar updates during
sync. Reduced TMDB rate-limit pressure for 1000+ item libraries.

### Obsidian Bases support

Documentation only — `trakt_poster_url` already works in Bases card
view (Obsidian 1.9.3+) as a raw external URL. Added a "View in Bases"
section to all 9 README languages.

### Title / Tagline customization clarification

MANUAL.md (4 languages) now has a "Common customizations" subsection
explaining that title is `{{title}}` in the body template (no separate
field), and tagline format is fully editable in the Movie template.

## 0.1.2 — 2026-05-10

**Docs only**: full restructure + multi-language docs system.

- Moved `doc/` → `docs/`; added `docs/screenshots/` and `docs/i18n/`
- Wrote new English `docs/SETUP.md` (Trakt + TMDB API key flow,
  troubleshooting)
- Translations matrix:
  - README × 9 languages: en + zh-CN + zh-TW + ja + ko + fr + de + es + it
  - SETUP × 4 languages: en + zh-CN + zh-TW + ja
  - MANUAL × 4 languages: en + zh-CN + zh-TW + ja
- Added `docs/i18n/index.md` as the navigation hub
- Redesigned README: badges, language switcher, feature sections with
  inline code examples, expandable install methods, roadmap

## 0.1.1 — 2026-05-09

**Fix: `{{watch_history}}` body section now updates in subsequent syncs.**

The default sync mode (`Overwrite existing note body` = off) only
updated frontmatter on existing notes — but `{{watch_history}}` is
rendered into the body. Result: watch history was frozen at note-
creation time and never reflected new episodes you watched after that.

Fix: machine-managed section markers using Obsidian's native `%% … %%`
comment syntax. The watch-history block is now wrapped in
`%% trakt:watch-history:start %%` … `%% trakt:watch-history:end %%`.
On every sync, when **Sync watch history (detailed)** is on, the engine
finds these markers and replaces what's between them. Content outside
the markers is never touched.

Notes created on 0.1.0 don't have markers yet; on the next sync after
upgrading to 0.1.1 the engine auto-appends a marker-wrapped Watch
History section to the end of each note's body.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-05-09

**First pre-stable release.** Forked from sarimabbas/traktr at upstream
tag 1.5.2 and substantially reworked. Three new feature areas on top
of the upstream sync engine:

### Detailed watch history

- New **Sync watch history (detailed)** toggle pulls Trakt's
  `/sync/history` endpoint and aggregates per-episode (or per-movie)
  watch timestamps
- Renders inline in the note body via `{{watch_history}}` and
  `{{watch_history_list}}` template variables
- Re-watches listed comma-separated; episodes sorted by season then
  episode

### Metadata localization

- New **Metadata language** setting translates `title` / `overview` /
  `tagline` / `genres` via TMDB (Trakt translations as fallback when
  no TMDB key)
- English originals preserved in `trakt_original_*` frontmatter fields
- Tags + tag-note paths always stay in English so existing Dataview
  queries keep working unchanged

### Bilingual UI + translated templates

- Plugin UI language picker (en / zh-CN) covering settings tab, command
  palette, notice popups, auth modal — ~90 string keys in
  `src/i18n.ts`
- Note template language picker (mirrors metadata-language preset
  list). Bundled translations: English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional
  Chinese; other codes fall back to English

### Repository

- Distinct plugin id (`obsidian-sync-trakt` vs upstream `traktr`) — both
  can coexist in the same vault
- Full upstream commit history preserved; this release branches from
  upstream commit `03fe853`

## Versioning policy

While in `0.x.y`, **patch bumps** (0.1.x) are used for any change that
ships, including bug fixes, new features, and docs. Minor bumps
(`0.2.0`, `0.3.0`) are reserved for changes substantial enough to merit
a [design spec](specs/) entry — this is a soft signal that the
codebase took a meaningful architectural step. The first `1.0.0`
release will follow standard semver from then on.
