## 1. What it does

This plugin pulls your [Trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv) data and creates one
Markdown note per movie or TV show in your vault. Each note contains:

- **Frontmatter** — structured metadata (title, year, genres, ratings, watch status, Trakt/IMDB/TMDB IDs, poster URL, sync timestamp)
- **Body** — rendered from a customizable template with `{{variable}}` placeholders
- **Tags** — automatically generated from the type, genres, and sync sources (optional)
- **Tag notes** — wikilinks to topic files for building a graph (optional)
- **Watch History** — opt-in section showing per-episode (or per-movie) watch timestamps from Trakt's `/sync/history` endpoint

Movies and shows live in the same folder and are distinguished by the `trakt_type` frontmatter field (`movie` or `show`). Dataview queries can filter by either.

This plugin is forked from [sarimabbas/traktr](https://github.com/sarimabbas/traktr); see the README for attribution and what's added.

## 2. Installation

Manual install:

1. Download `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` from the [latest release](https://github.com/o1xhack/obsidian-sync-trakt/releases/latest)
2. In your vault, create the folder `.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-sync-trakt/`
3. Copy the three files into that folder
4. Open Obsidian → Settings → Community plugins → enable **Obsidian Sync Trakt**

Or via [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat): add the beta plugin
`o1xhack/obsidian-sync-trakt`.

---

## 3. Initial setup

### 3a. Create a Trakt application

1. Sign in to [trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv) and go to **Settings → Your API Apps → New Application**
2. Give it any name (e.g. "Traktr")
3. For **Redirect URI**, enter `urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob`
4. Save. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### 3b. (Optional) Get a TMDB API key

Poster images are fetched from [The Movie Database](https://themoviedb.org). A free API key is sufficient. If you skip this, notes are created without poster images.

1. Create an account at themoviedb.org
2. Go to **Settings → API → Create → Developer**
3. Copy the **API Key (v3 auth)**

---

## 4. Authentication flow

1. Open **Settings → Traktr**
2. Paste your **Trakt Client ID** and **Client Secret**
3. Click **Connect to Trakt** — a modal opens showing a URL and a short device code
4. Visit the URL in a browser, enter the code, and approve access
5. The modal polls Trakt and closes automatically once authorized
6. The Connection status field shows "Connected to Trakt"

To revoke access, click **Disconnect** in the settings tab or run the command **Traktr: Disconnect account**.

Access tokens are refreshed automatically before each sync (no manual re-authentication needed).

---

## 5. Settings reference

### Authentication

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| Trakt Client ID | From your Trakt API application. |
| Trakt Client Secret | From the same application page. |
| Connection status | Shows current state; buttons to connect or disconnect. |

### TMDB (poster images)

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| TMDB API key | _(blank)_ | Optional. Leave blank to skip poster images. |
| Poster size | `w500` | Image width variant fetched from TMDB. Options: w92, w154, w185, w342, w500, w780, original. |
| TMDB cache TTL | `90 days` | How long cached TMDB metadata stays fresh before being revalidated. **Never expire** keeps entries indefinitely (only manually cleared). Stale entries are returned immediately and refreshed in the background, so syncs are never blocked. Each entry gets ±5 days jitter, so 1000+ items don't all expire on the same day. See [spec 0001](specs/0001-incremental-sync.md) §A. |
| Clear cache | _(button)_ | Drops every cached metadata entry. The next sync re-fetches everything from TMDB (takes a few minutes for large libraries). The setting label shows the current entry count. |

### Localization

Optional. Translate `title`, `overview`, `tagline`, and `genres` in synced notes. Tags and tag-note wikilinks always stay in English so existing Dataview queries keep working.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Metadata language | `Default (English / Trakt original)` | Locale for translated metadata. Selecting `Default` disables localization; existing notes stay byte-identical to the pre-i18n behavior. Presets cover Simplified/Traditional Chinese, Japanese, Korean, English variants, French, German, Spanish (ES/MX), Brazilian Portuguese, Italian, and Russian; pick `Custom` to enter any BCP 47 code (e.g. `tr-TR`). |
| Custom language code | `(blank)` | Only shown when `Custom` is selected above. |

When localization is enabled, sync resolves translations in this order:

1. **TMDB** (preferred) — one combined call per item that returns the localized `title` / `overview` / `tagline` / `genres` plus the poster URL. Requires a TMDB API key.
2. **Trakt `/translations/{lang}`** (fallback) — used when no TMDB API key is configured. Covers `title` / `overview` / `tagline` only; `genres` stay in English.
3. **English original** — used field-by-field when neither API has a translation in the requested language.

### Notes

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Notes folder | `trakt` | Vault folder where all notes are created. Created automatically if missing. |
| Filename template | `{{title}} ({{year}})` | Template for note filenames. Variables: `{{title}}`, `{{year}}`, `{{imdb_id}}`, `{{trakt_id}}`. |
| Property prefix | `trakt_` | Prefix for all frontmatter properties written by the plugin (e.g. `trakt_title`, `trakt_watched`). Leave blank for no prefix. |

### Note templates

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Movie note template | _(see below)_ | Markdown template for the body of movie notes. Uses `{{variable}}` syntax. |
| TV show note template | _(see below)_ | Markdown template for the body of TV show notes. Uses `{{variable}}` syntax. |

Both templates have a **Reset to default** button.

**Common customizations:**

- **Title** — there's no separate "Title" template field. The title becomes the note's **filename** (controlled by the **Filename template** setting), and it's also exposed as the `{{title}}` variable for the body. To show the title as a heading at the top of every note, add `# {{title}}` to the start of your Movie / TV show template.
- **Tagline** — the bundled movie template renders the tagline as a blockquote (`> {{tagline}}`). Edit the template directly to change the format — e.g. `**Tagline:** *{{tagline}}*` for an inline label, or just delete the line. Shows don't have a tagline in Trakt's data, so the show template doesn't reference one.
- **Anything else** — every variable in [§ 6.3 Template variables](#template-variables) is available; you can rearrange / remove sections freely. Click **Reset to default** if you want to start over.

### Tags

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Add tags | on | Add Obsidian tags to frontmatter on each sync (e.g. `#trakt/genre/action`). |
| Tag prefix | `trakt` | Prefix for generated tags (e.g. `trakt` → `#trakt/movie`, `#trakt/genre/action`). |

### Tag notes

Tag notes are topic files you link to from your notes, creating a graph of connections. Use either tags or tag notes — using both is redundant.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Add tag notes to frontmatter | off | Adds a wikilink list property to frontmatter on each sync (e.g. `[[trakt/genre/action]]`). Alternatively, use `{{tag_notes}}` in your template to place links in the note body instead. |
| Create tag notes | off | Automatically create empty tag note files if they don't exist. |
| Tag notes folder | `trakt` | Vault folder for tag note files. Used for frontmatter links, file creation, and the `{{tag_notes}}` template variable. |

### Sync sources

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Sync watchlist | on | Items on your Trakt watchlist (things you want to watch). |
| Sync favorites | on | Items you've marked as favorites. |
| Sync watch history | off | Items you've watched. Adds play count and last-watched date per item. Can be a large dataset. |
| Sync watch history (detailed) | off | Layered on top of the toggle above. Pulls Trakt's `/sync/history` endpoint and surfaces per-episode (or per-movie) watch timestamps via the `{{watch_history}}` template variable. As of 0.2.0 the sync is **incremental** — subsequent syncs only fetch events newer than the last sync, plus a periodic full re-pull (configurable below) to detect deletions. Off by default; only shown when "Sync watch history" is on. |
| History full-refresh interval (days) | `7` | _(only shown when Sync watch history (detailed) is on)_ How often the plugin re-fetches the entire Trakt watch history (instead of just new events) to detect deletions on Trakt's side. Smaller value = faster deletion detection at the cost of an occasional slow sync. |
| Clear history state | _(button)_ | _(only shown when detailed sync is on)_ Drops the locally aggregated watch history. Next sync rebuilds from scratch. The label shows current counts (movies / shows / events tracked). |
| Sync ratings | off | Items you've rated (1–10). |

### Sync behavior

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Sync movies | on | Include movies in the sync. |
| Sync TV shows | on | Include TV shows in the sync. |
| Sync on startup | off | Automatically run a sync when Obsidian loads (5-second delay). |
| Auto-sync | off | Periodically sync in the background. |
| Auto-sync interval | 60 min | How often to auto-sync (5–360 minutes). Visible only when auto-sync is enabled. |
| Overwrite existing note body | off | When **off**, only frontmatter is updated and the note body is preserved. When **on**, the full note is regenerated from the template on every sync — any edits you've made to the note body will be permanently lost. |
| Remove notes for deleted items | off | When **on**, notes for items no longer in any enabled sync source are moved to trash. |

### Reset

**Reset to defaults** restores all settings to their defaults. Authentication credentials and TMDB API key are preserved.

### Watch history rendering

When **Sync watch history (detailed)** is enabled, the body of each watched
note gets a `## Watch History` (or 观看记录 / 觀看紀錄) section listing every
watch event:

For shows — one bullet per episode, with all watch timestamps comma-separated
when an episode was rewatched:

```markdown
## Watch History
- S1E1 — 2024-01-15 21:30, 2024-03-22 19:00
- S1E2 — 2024-01-16 22:00
- S1E3 — 2024-01-17 21:45
- S2E1 — 2024-04-02 20:00
```

For movies — one bullet per watch event:

```markdown
## Watch History
- 2023-12-25 19:00
- 2024-06-10 22:30
- 2025-02-14 20:15
```

Timestamps are formatted in your local timezone (Trakt stores them as UTC,
the renderer converts to local before display). Episodes are sorted by
season then episode number; timestamps within an episode are
chronologically sorted.

---

## 7. Sync behavior

### Create vs. update

- **New item** (no existing note with matching `trakt_type` + `trakt_id`): a note is created using the full template.
- **Existing item**: behavior depends on the **Overwrite existing note body** setting:
  - **Off** (default): only the frontmatter block is updated; everything below `---` is left untouched, so your personal notes are preserved.
  - **On**: the entire note (frontmatter + body) is regenerated from the template — body edits are lost.

### Delete

When **Remove notes for deleted items** is enabled, any note whose composite `type:id` is no longer found in any enabled sync source is moved to the system trash at the end of each sync.

### Changing language

When you switch **Metadata language** and run sync again:

- Frontmatter is rewritten in the new language; `trakt_original_*` fields keep the English values regardless.
- If your **filename template** contains `{{title}}`, every note will be renamed to the new-language title on the next sync. Obsidian's link-update will fix wikilinks automatically, but **back up your vault first**.
- To keep filenames stable across language switches, change the template to `{{original_title}} ({{year}})` *before* changing the language.
- Tags (`#trakt/genre/...`) and tag-note wikilinks (`[[trakt/genre/...]]`) always use the original English genre list, so existing Dataview queries keep working unchanged.
- Switching back to **Default (English / Trakt original)** rewrites frontmatter back to English; on the next sync the `trakt_original_*` and `trakt_metadata_language` fields are no longer written, so they'll persist on existing notes until you remove them or regenerate notes (enable **Overwrite existing note body** for one sync to fully regenerate).

### Running a sync

- **Manual**: command **Traktr: Sync** (accessible via the command palette)
- **On startup**: enable **Sync on startup** in settings (runs 5 seconds after Obsidian loads)
- **Scheduled**: enable **Auto-sync** and set an interval
- **Force full history refresh**: command **Traktr: Force full watch-history refresh** — bypasses the periodic interval and immediately re-pulls the entire Trakt history. Useful when you've just deleted a wrong scrobble on Trakt and want the plugin to detect it now
- **Clear TMDB cache**: command **Traktr: Clear TMDB metadata cache** — empties every cached TMDB entry. The next sync re-fetches all metadata from TMDB. Same effect as the Settings → TMDB → **Clear cache** button

### How sync stays fast (0.2.0+)

After the first sync seeds the local caches, subsequent syncs are bounded by API calls for genuinely new data:

- **TMDB metadata cache** survives across syncs and across devices. A movie's title / poster / overview is fetched once and reused until either the configured TTL elapses or you click Clear cache. ~5-10 calls per typical sync instead of ~1200
- **Trakt history incremental fetch** uses `?start_at=<lastSync>`. A normal week's worth of new watches usually fits in a single page (1 API call). The periodic full re-pull happens once per `History full-refresh interval (days)` to catch deletions

See [`specs/0001-incremental-sync.md`](specs/0001-incremental-sync.md) for the full design rationale.

### Dataview example queries

Filter by type:
```dataview
TABLE trakt_year, trakt_rating, trakt_watched
FROM "trakt"
WHERE trakt_type = "movie"
SORT trakt_rating DESC
```

Show only favorites:
```dataview
TABLE trakt_year, trakt_my_rating
FROM "trakt"
WHERE trakt_favorite = true
SORT trakt_my_rating DESC
```

Show your watchlist:
```dataview
TABLE trakt_year, trakt_type, trakt_genres
FROM "trakt"
WHERE trakt_watchlist = true
SORT trakt_year DESC
```
