**Turn your [Trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv) watch history into a richly localized Markdown library — with per-episode timestamps, metadata in 15+ languages, and quiet incremental sync that doesn't churn your vault.**

## ✨ Why?

- **Detailed watch history** — exactly which episode you watched at what time, including re-watches, kept in sync as you keep watching
- **Metadata in 15+ languages** — translate titles / overviews / taglines / genres via TMDB. Built-in presets for Chinese (CN / TW / HK), Japanese, Korean, French, German, Spanish (ES / MX), Portuguese (BR), Italian, Russian — plus a custom mode that accepts any TMDB-supported BCP-47 locale code. English originals are always preserved alongside in `*_original_*` frontmatter fields
- **Fast incremental sync** _(0.2.0)_ — first sync seeds the local TMDB cache + Trakt history state; subsequent syncs only fetch what changed. Steady-state sync time drops from minutes to single-digit seconds. See [spec 0001](docs/specs/0001-incremental-sync.md)
- **Quiet writes** _(0.3.0)_ — sync only rewrites notes whose content actually changed. After watching one new episode, a 1200-item library writes one note instead of all 1200 — your cross-device sync layer (Obsidian Sync / iCloud / Syncthing) stops re-uploading the entire library every run. See [spec 0002](docs/specs/0002-diff-based-write.md)

## 🎬 Detailed watch history

When **Sync watch history (detailed)** is enabled, the plugin queries Trakt's `/sync/history` endpoint and inlines per-episode (or per-movie) timestamps into the note body — and keeps that block updated as you watch new episodes:

```markdown
## Watch History
- S1E1 — 2024-01-15 21:30, 2024-03-22 19:00
- S1E2 — 2024-01-16 22:00
- S1E3 — 2024-01-17 21:45
- S2E1 — 2024-04-02 20:00
```

Re-watches are listed comma-separated; episodes sort by season then episode number. The block is wrapped in `%% trakt:watch-history %%` markers — the plugin updates only what's between the markers, so any hand-written notes elsewhere in the body are never touched.

## 🌐 Metadata localization

Set **Metadata language** to your preference and synced notes get title, overview, tagline, and genres translated via TMDB (with Trakt's translation endpoint as a fallback when no TMDB key is configured). English originals stay in `trakt_original_*` frontmatter fields:

```yaml
trakt_title: 黑暗骑士
trakt_original_title: The Dark Knight
trakt_genres:
  - 动作
  - 犯罪
  - 剧情
trakt_original_genres:
  - Action
  - Crime
  - Drama
trakt_metadata_language: zh-CN
```

Tags and tag-note paths always stay in English — your existing Dataview queries keep working unchanged.

## 🌍 Plugin UI + note templates

Metadata localization above covers many languages; the plugin's own UI surface is a separate, smaller story. **Settings tab, command palette, and notice popups** currently speak **English** and **简体中文**. **Bundled note templates** ship in English, Simplified Chinese (`zh-CN`), and Traditional Chinese (`zh-TW` / `zh-HK`); other template-language codes fall back to the English template — edit the template manually for now, or [open an issue](https://github.com/o1xhack/obsidian-sync-trakt/issues) to request a bundled translation. More UI languages on demand.

## 🔄 Cross-device sync

Auth state — Trakt tokens, TMDB key, all settings — lives in `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-sync-trakt/data.json` and follows your vault-sync layer. Configure auth once on Mac, share with iPhone via Obsidian Sync (with `Plugin data` enabled), Syncthing, iCloud + Advanced Data Protection, or Cryptomator. The plugin doesn't store anything on a server.

## 📊 View your library in Obsidian Bases

The `trakt_poster_url` frontmatter field works out-of-the-box with [Obsidian Bases](https://help.obsidian.md/bases) (Obsidian 1.9.3+). Build a database view of your sync folder and display posters as thumbnails:

- **Card view**: open Display settings → set **Image property** to `trakt_poster_url`
- **Table view** (1.9.4+): add a formula column with `image(note.trakt_poster_url)`

Filter by `trakt_type = "movie"` / `"show"`, sort by `trakt_year` / `trakt_rating` / `trakt_my_rating`, group by `trakt_genres`. The same frontmatter properties that power Dataview queries also power Bases views — no extra setup.

## 🚀 Quick start

1. Install via [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) → **Add a beta plugin for testing** → `o1xhack/obsidian-sync-trakt`
2. Settings → **Sync Trakt** → fill your Trakt + TMDB API keys ([SETUP guide](docs/SETUP.md))
3. Command palette → **Traktr: Sync**

## 🔑 API keys: what each one unlocks

The plugin uses two APIs. **Trakt is mandatory** — without it, the plugin can't sync anything. **TMDB is optional** but unlocks most of what makes the plugin worth installing. Here's the breakdown:

| Feature | Trakt API<br/>_(required)_ | TMDB API<br/>_(recommended)_ |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Sync your Trakt library (watchlist, watched, favorites, ratings) | ✅ | — |
| Per-episode watch timestamps | ✅ | — |
| Title / overview / tagline in your language | ✅ basic | ✅ higher quality |
| **Genres in your language** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Poster images embedded in notes** | ❌ | ✅ |

If you only want English content and no posters, you can leave TMDB blank — Trakt alone is enough. If you want any non-English localization beyond title/overview/tagline, **add a TMDB key** ([free signup](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api)). After pasting your key, click the **Test** button next to the field to confirm it works before your first sync.

## 🤝 Acknowledgements

This plugin was originally inspired by [sarimabbas/traktr](https://github.com/sarimabbas/traktr) (MIT licensed), which provided the initial Trakt OAuth scaffolding. Substantial subsequent work — detailed watch-history aggregation, metadata localization with translation-fallback chains, bilingual UI, bounded-concurrency fetching with live progress reporting, machine-managed body sections, the translation-aware template renderer, multi-language docs — has reshaped most of the codebase into a fundamentally different architecture.

Thanks to [Sarim Abbas](https://github.com/sarimabbas) for the starting point. The original work's MIT copyright notice is preserved verbatim in [LICENSE](LICENSE) alongside this project's own.
